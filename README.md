# Web APIs: JavaScript Code Quiz

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## The Project
The project outcome is to create a website that showcases quiz questions related to Javascript. The user must get the right answer on their quiz or else 10 seconds gets taken off their overall score. The score starts at  100 and decreases or stays the same depending on how long the user takes to answer the question! They can then see a leaderboard at the end of the quiz and submit their initials to claim the top spot!
